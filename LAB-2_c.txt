# "%.2f": This prints only 2 decimal value after . [ Example : 10.123456 becomes 10.12 ]
# scanf(" %f%f",&a,&b) : Here, if we make a gap between %f's, compiler consides the gap as an input [ Not mandatory ]
# float takes the same amout of space as integer in the memory.
# double takes the double amount of space that float takes in memory.
# double -> %lf

# char character -> makes a character variable

# scanf(" %c,&char) -> Here we need to put a space after the first coatation to have it run perfectly [For character]
# scanf(" %s,&string) -> Here we need to put a space after the first coatation to have it run perfectly [For string]

# float c = (float) a/b; -> This is called type casting

# % operator prints the remainer of a division operation
    5%2 -> 1
    here 2 is quotient
    and 1 is remainder
