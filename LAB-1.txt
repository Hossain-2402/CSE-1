printf("Something\n"):
	"\n" makes a line break

	prints : Hello World"
printf("Hello World\\"):
	prints : Hello World \
int :
	int takes a 8 byte space 	
	if I put a huge number which is not possible to store in INT varuable, it will show a garbage value that is not same as what I initialized.
scanf: 
	The following code is not valid : scanf("%d\n",&a); here, the '\n' is not allowed.
